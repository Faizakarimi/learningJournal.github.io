                Path,
                I've made the big jump over
                to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
                peers.

                <p class="titles">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then
                    try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                    projects.
                </p>
                <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about my journey with the world.
                </p>

                <p class="titles">How I got started</p>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                    learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
                    also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
